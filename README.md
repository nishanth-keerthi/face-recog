This is a face recognition software which first stores your data into the dataset after you run the face_data_collect.py 
It then flattens it and converts it into a numpy array and resizes your image captured to 100*100
Using Haarcascades 
Then on running the face_recognition.py it recognizes your face and returns the name you stored it under
NOTE:create folder called 'data' in your root folder before running the program so that the images captured are stored in a .npy format in that folder
